In fact Yarrow is a member of the daisy family,  . The plants have feathery leaves arranged around the stems, which can grow up to a metre but are usually less than 0.5m tall, and an inflorescence comprises three to eight (usually five) roundish ray flowers surrounding between 15 and 40 tiny disc flowers.  \n       Yarrow is very common throughout Britain and Ireland, and it occurs also across Europe and Asia as well as in North America. This wayside wildflower is found mainly on drier slopes and meadows as well as on many grassy roadside verges.   blooms in Britain and Ireland from June until October, and is generally at its best in July and August. Yarrow can reproduce either by means of seeds or by vegetative means. The oblong to lance-shaped fruits of Yarrow are about 2mm long, flattened, and ribbed longitudinally.  \n       Each fruit of Yarrow, known as an achene, contains a single seed, but reproduction is also achieved vegetatively by means of underground creeping stems known as rhizomes, from which new plants (which are therefore clones of the parent plant) arise. Considered a plant of the devil in Wales, this wildflower has long been thought to bring bad luck (or even death) if its flowers are brought in to a home. Yarrow is, in any case,  There are many traditional medical uses recorded for this plant, including its use as an astringent to cure bleeding noses.  Herbal tea can be made from the flowers, although given its known medical properties this practice seems rather inadvisable. (We strongly advise against eating or using as medicines any plants without first obtaining qualified professional advice.)  \n       The generic botanical name   stems from the belief that Achilles used Yarrow to treat the wounds of his soldiers. The finely divided leaves give it its specific name (  means 'with 1000 leaflets'). Most Yarrow flowers are white or cream, but some have a mauve flush or occasionally a purple tinge. Other colour forms seen in the wild are almost certainly the result of garden escapes.  In Scandinavia a red-flowered form of Yarrow is found occasionally in the wild. It is not a separate species nor even a subspecies but rather merely a hereditary colour variant; however, selective breeding in cultivation has enabled nurseries to produce Yarrow cultivars raging through white, cream and yellow to mauve, purple, pink and red. Sneezewort,  , has larger flowers (and fewer of them) with eight petals or occasionally more; it grows in damp grassland sites."},

Thrift forms rounded cushions up to 40cm tall, comprising pinkish flowers in compact inflorescenses above tufts of densely-packed grass-like leaves arising from a woody rootstock. The individual flowers have five pink or mauve petals, each with three darker pink veins, and five anthers that hold the creamy yellow pollen.  Thrift is common around the coasts of Britain and Ireland. Popular as a garden plant, cultivated varieties as garden escapes are quite common, especially near to towns and villages.   is also found in many temperate parts of Europe, Asia and North America.  If you walk along coastal paths you will see plenty of these striking wildflowers. They grow on the grassy slopes and in rock crevices and on ledges, sometimes creating huge dense mats of bright pink. Thrift can grow in tremendously diverse habitats such as salt marshes and occasionally mountain slopes and exposed river gravel.   The first few flowers appear in March, and Thrift is usually at its very best in May and June. Most years a few flowers can still be found at the end of September and sometimes well in to October.  There is an ancient but probably quite unfounded belief that extracts made from Thrift can be used to cure lead poisoning. The family name Plumbaginaceae reflects this supposition.

Well, at least the specific epithet is a lot more obvious:   means of the sea - appropriate for this mainly coastal wildflower. The common name Thrift probably refers to way that the leaves are closely packed together so as to conserve moisture in the salt-laden sea air. Sea Rose   is a taller, usually paler wildflower found in the Mediterranean region.

By the following morning the hairs have withered and the flies, now covered with pollen, are able to escape and move on to other flowers and so complete the pollination cycle.  Cretan Birthwort is relatively rare and not easy to find. Its habitats are shady and rocky places and the plant and flowers are well disguised by surrounding grass and other plants.   is endemic to Crete and Karpathos.

The hood eventually opens to reveal a complex purplish spadix that looks rather like a fireworks sparkler, comprising a long club above a narrower stem. The female flowers develop at the bottom of the spadix, with an annulus of male flowers positioned immediately above them.  By mid summer the female flower has produced a cluster of green berries that ripen and turn orange-red as the leaves and the hood decay. Stems laden with berries persist through the autumn and into winter, and by the end of the year fallen berry-laden stems are all there is to mark the site where, in a month or two, the new leaves and then flowers will emerge.  Common throughout Britain and Ireland, this unusual wildflower is found throughout most of mainland Europe and in parts of western Asia.    is a frequent sight beside tree-lined riversidepaths and shady lanes as well as on woodland edges, in scrub land and almost anywhere that is shaded and damp with nutrient-rich soil.  The flowers of Lords and Ladies open in April and May, and then the hood decays leaving a stem on which berries develop and ripen in the autumn. Roasted roots of   were used to produce a kind of drink; however, without proper preparation the resulting beverage can be toxic. There is also a danger that young children might be tempted to eat the brightly coloured berries (although they are very bitter tasting), with serious consequences because this is such a poisonous plant.

Wild Pansy  subsp , commonly referred to as Heartsease, is an annual or sometimes perennial of cultivated land; it grows rather taller (up to 45cm in height occasionally) than Dune Pansies do (perhaps due to being mnore sheltered from strong winds) and  its petals are most often mainly or entirely mauve. Flowers of the Dune Pansy have five petals, the top two overlapping slightly; there are two smaller wing petals and a single large lower petal with radial reddish-brown lines (honey guides) in the central third of the petal. The leaves are toothed, oval with a heart-shaped base and leaf-like pinnately-lobed stipules. On mainland Britain  ssp  is mainly confined to the western coast, although there are a few sites in East Anglia where Dune Pansies are quite common. The coast of Wales, particularly around the Isle of Anglesey, is particularly good for this species, as also are dune systems forther north in Lancashire and along much of the west coast of Scotland as well as the Scottish western islands. Dune Pansies are also found along nearly all of the coast of the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland. On mainland Europe  Dune Pansies are recorded along much of the Atlantic coast and in some places on the southern coast of the Baltic Sea. Almost entirely coastal, the Dune Pansy is aptly named because its main habitat is sand dunes; however, in the past these wildflowers were often transplanted to sandy inland gardens too.  In Britain and Ireland Dune Pansies can be found in bloom in springtime and again in the autumn, and so it is usually possible to find flowers in prime condition from April right through to September.  Fritillary butterflies make good use of the leaves of all kinds of wild pansies: these are their larval foodplants. The Dune Pansy has larger flowers than the tiny Field Pansy   which has yellow flowers and grows in unimproved permanent pastures inland but is otherwise quite similar, with difference mainly in sepal to petal size ratios.  Common Dog-violet   and Early Dog-violets   favour woodland edges and shady banks beneath hedgerows. Sweet Violets  , usually the first violet species we find in the wild in Britain, have downy stems and leaves; they grow in woods. As the name suggests, they  have a strong and pleasant scent.

This perennial plant spreads mainly by means of above-ground runners, which are referred to as as 'stolons' in botanical literature. The flowers have five petals backed by small pointed sepals.  A distinguishing feature of the Common Dog-violet is its upturned flower spur, which is much paler than the flower petals (the spur is often white or nearly so) and is notched or furrowed towards its tip. Most commonly seen on roadside banks and woodland edges, Dog Violets have a habit of hiding among other vegetation beneath hedgerows, and unless forming large patches they are not always  easy to spot.  The Common Dog-violet is indeed very common and widespread throughout the UK and Ireland, where it is by far the most abundant of the violet species. This wildflower is native to most of mainland Europe and parts of North Africa; its range extends into Asia. Common Dog-violets (referred to  as Dog-violets because they are scentless and were therefore considered as fit only for dogs) bloom chiefly from mid March to mid June, but occasionally you will see them as early as the end of February and, in shady upland locations, as late as the start of July.

In Scandinavia this violet is also common in broad-leaved woodlands and crouched beneath other vegetation in tundra. The flowers appear in May and June at lower altitudes but may be seen well in to July in colder high-altitude locations.   Most members of the family violaceae have flowers with some purplish areas or at least flowers some of which have purple or violet in their colouring. The genus name   reflects this feature; however,   is an exception in that it has consistently yellow flowers. The specific epithet   means 'with two flowers'. You might  therefore expect that the flowers are borne in pairs, but they are not. Rather, the name refers to the fact that this species produces two kinds of flowers: as well as the lovely and conspicuous yellow flowers it also produces, low down under the leaves, pairs of very basic flowers that do not open but self fertilise within their buds - a process known as cleistogamy.

Distinguished by its dense, spiked inflorescence on an unbranching, ascending stem, Spiked Speedwell grows to a height of 10 to 40cm (usually 15 to 25cm). The stems are square in cross section and usually covered in dense grey hairs. The short-stalked flowers, which are usually purplish blue but very occasionally white, are 6 to 8mm across with fused petals in four lobes and prominent stamens. The finely hairy  elongated oval leaves, whose margins are very finely crenate (with small rounded teeth), are stalked, arching and slightly ascending, and they are borne in opposite pairs along the stem, larger at the base and becoming progressively smaller towards the terminal raceme of flowers. \n       Spiked Speedwell is rare in Britain. One of its remaining strongholds is Great Orme, near Llandudno in North Wales, where it grows in limestone grassland. There are scattered sites on alkaline soils in the Severn Estuary and on England's north-east coast and in the upper Ribble Valley, while southern Scotland also has at least one site for this rarity. In East Anglia there are sites on sandy soils where a subspecies of Spike Speedwell occurs.   is also found in alkaline habitats in some parts of  mainland Europe. Throughout the temperate world cultivars of this lovely speedwell have long been popular plants for parks and gardens.

Spiked Speedwell is the origin of many popular cultivars including 'Icicle' (a white spike), 'Red Fox' (red, of course), and 'Royal Candles' (with blue flower spikes).

Each stem has a solitary flower between 15 and 30mm in diameter made up of numerous narrow rays (most people call them petals, which is not strictly correct) surrounding central disc florets. The pinkish stems, which are covered in scales, appear before the large heart-shaped leaves.  \n       The square-section stems are reddish at first, paling to green as theflowers develop. Where the leaf-stalk attaches to the leaf there is a u-shaped bract that was thought to resemble the foot of a colt; this may be the origin of the English common name, although an unopened drooping flower bud seems to fit the bill reasonably well, too. Perhaps the most credible of the many suggestions is that the leaves are shaped like the hoofprint of a colt. (Note the scalloped leaf shape pictured below.) Rather like Dandelions, the seeds of a Colt's-foot flower form a 'clock' (formally referred to as a pappus), each individual seed having its own hairy parachute. Clouds of these little parachutes are distributed upon the breeze. This spring wildflower is common throughout Britain and Ireland, and it occurs also in most northern European countries.  \n       We have seen Colt's-foot on the gravelly banks of the   in Russia's Kola Peninsula, well inside the Arctic Circle.  This wildflower was introduced to many oter parts of the world, including North and South America, for its medical properties, and has since become naturalised; as a result Colt's-foot is now an invasive nuisance weed in many places. Favouring poor soils and sunny locations, Colt's-foot often occurs beside ditches and streams or on compacted gravelly paths and tracks.  The flowers first appear as soon as we get the first warm days in February and are usually over before the end of April; however, the 'clocks' are also very attractive.  Colt's-foot leaves, which appear just as the flowers are fading (from whence comes one of its old common names 'Son before Father') continue growing throughout the spring and early summer months and eventually are large enough to be mistaken for Butterbur.  \n       , the genus name, is a reference to the reputed ability of Colt's-foot to cure coughs. (The Latin verb   means to cough.) The specific epithet   is the ancient Latin name for the wildflower Colt's-foot. The English common name of this wildflower is written as Coltsfoot in some field guides.  Seedheads of Colt's-foot were once used to stuff pillows, and in herbal medicine an extract prepared from the roots is used as an expectorant for the relief of coughs. The Colt's-foot plants shown on this page were photographed in West Wales during February and March."},

Wall Pennywort also thrives in warmer climates, including the Algarve region of southern Portugal. The stalked fleshy succulent leaves, most of which grow as a basal rosette and range from 1 to 8cm in diameter, are round and often have slightly scalloped edges, The name Pennywort refers to the shape and typical size of the leaves and refers to a pre-decimal penny, of course! Each leaf has a shallow central depression - hence one of its other common names, Navelwort. The five-petalled tubular flowers grow along a stout stem, and they open from the bottom of the spike. Flower spikes up to 25cm tall are quite common, although a height of 10 to 20cm is more typical. Older plants may produce several flower stems. This succulent plant, a member of the Stonecrop family, has its leaves joined into a tube. Navelwort, also known as Wall Pennywort, is commonly found on walls and steep banks, especially in permanently damp, shaded areas.  When exposed to sunlight and drought theleaves curl up and the stems and flowers turn reddish, while in damp shaded locations the whole plant retains its green colours. In shady situations, palid spikes of bell-shaped flowers of the navelwort first appear in May, and the green fruits ripen and turn brown through the summer months.  Wall Pennywort grows on damp coastal cliffs, on roadside banks, near the trunks of large trees and particularly from crevices in garden walls and field boundary dry-stone walls. This pioneering plant even colonises holes in tree trunks, gaps in roof gutters and the sides and tops of dry-stone walls. In Britain and Ireland   can be seen in flower during May, June and early July. The dried stems with their brown fruits persist through summer and autumn, occasionally remaining intact as new flower spikes start to emerge in the following springtime. In southern Europe, Wall Pennywort can be seen in flower from the start of the calendar year, and the fruits have usually ripened by early April. The plants shown above on this page were photographed in Wales during June and July, while the picture below, taken in March, shows Wall Pennywort growing on a farm roof in the Algarve region of southern Portugal.   The leaves of Wall Pennywort can be found throughout the year, and some people use them in salads; they taste rather like salty lettuce but have the sweetness of melon or, some say, cucumber.

Larger than most other members of the family Ranunculaceae, Globeflowers are hairless perennials and can reach a height of 50 to 70cm. The deeply-cut palmate leaves look very similar to those of Meadow Buttercup except that their upper and lower surfaces are smooth rather than downy. \n       Five to fifteen incurved yellow sepals (which most people refer to as the 'petals') make up the cup of the flower, which is indeed globular and 3 to 5cm in diameter. Unlike other buttercups, the flowers usually remain closed or nearly so, and they are pollinated by flies that are small enough to creep in between the sepals to gain access. Globeflower seeds ripen between July and September and are transported to new locations by grazing animals, which appear to be unaffected by toxins known to occur in these plants. The seeds are deposited completes with an abundant supply of organic 'compost'!  During the winter, when the stems have died back, a basal rosette of toothed palmate leaves, each with three to five large segments that are further divided, persists through to the following spring. This makes locating Globeflower plants quite easy at any time of the year.  \n       These lovely yellow wildflowers can be found in Britain and Ireland, but they very rare or not found other than in parts of Wales, northern Ireland, northern England and Scotland, where they are more common the further north you travel.  Globeflower is native to northern and central Europe but, being unable to cope with hot weather, in southern countries this wildflower is confined to cool, damp alpine regions.  Globeflowers grow in sunlit or partially-shaded sites such as damp meadows, marshy gullies and the boggy margins of lakes, particularly where the soil is alkaline or at least neutral. In alpine regions in mainland Europe we see this species most often in sunny positions sheltered from the wind by hardwood trees or bushes.  \n       Globeflowers create a wonderful splash of colour during their blooming season in June, July and August. Where they do occur, Globeflowers can form large clumps, and so they are planted beside large garden ponds and lakes within parks. Being slightly poisonous, this plant has been used in the past as a purgative. (We strongly advise against eating or using as medicines any plants without first obtaining qualified professional advice.)        comes from the German  , meaning globular flower, while   simply refers to the region to which this species is native. (There are about 30 known   species, some of which are native to Asia and the Americas.) Globeflower is sometimes written as two words Globe Flower or hyphenated as Globe-flower.  Greater Spearwort   also produces large yellow flowers, but they open out rather than remaining globular. The leaves of Greater Spearwort are lanceolate and untoothed. In North America  , a similar plant that is also known as Globeflower, is found over a large range.

The flowers appear in May and June, often making lovely displays with Bluebells and other early spring flowers.  At one time, comfrey leaves were used as dressings for cuts, bruises and broken bones, although in the latter case it was the roots of the plant that were combined with other substances and used as a kind of latter-day plaster of Paris. There are many comfrey species, some of which have creamy-white flowers (see the example below); identifying them to species level is a task for experts!.  Infusions of the plants were used in the treatment of gastric ulcers and other stomach complaints although today this concentrated form of comfrey is discouraged because of the levels of liver-damaging alkaloids to be found in these mixtures.  Comfrey leaves are still used for culinary purposes and the leaves eaten in salads although small quantities are recommended.  Comfreys were first introduced to the UK as a fodder plant and have since become naturalised. Today they are used mainly as a type of green fertiliser.

Hedge Woundwort is an erect perennial plant that can grow up to a metre in height and forms patches in shady places beside hedges and on woodland edges.  As with other members of the   genus, the solid stems of Hedge Woundwort have a square cross section, and they may be either unbranched or very occasionally branched. The stems are more noticeably hairy in the upper region of the plant, and there are nodes widely spaced along the stem. From each node emerges a pair of opposite stalked hairy leaves; these are an elongated heart shape and toothed rather like the leaves of Stinging Nettle. (When it is not in flower, it is all too easy to mistake Hedge Woundwort for a nettle - and  ; however, the leaves of   species do not sting.) There is no rosette of basal leaves.  There is an unpleasant smell associated with this plant, and it is particularly strong and pungent if the stems or the leaves are crushed. Insignificant when viewed from a distance, the reddish-purple fused bilabiate flowers of Hedge Woundwort have a convex (hooded) upper lobe, while the tri-lobed lower lip is intricately patterned with white markings.  Ranging from 13 to 18mm long, the finely-hairy flowers are borne in whorls around stems, forming inflorescences in interrupted spikes that are very beautiful when studied at close quarters.  Hedge Woundwort is found throughout Britain and Ireland, where it is a fairly common sight. This wildflower occurs throughout most of Europe except the far north of Scandinavia, and it is also recorded in many parts of Asia.  \n        favours the edges of deciduous woodlands and hedgerows, but it can also be seen on waste ground and occasionally beside rivers and lakes (where   also occurs). In Britain and Ireland the main blooming period of Hedge Woundwort is July and August, but it is usually possible to find a few early flowers in June and stragglers as late as the end of September or some years even into mid October. This plant has a long history of use in herbalism, and as the common name implies it was regarded as very good for dressing cuts and other wounds. Woundwort is reputed to cure aching joints when made into an ointment and to have antispasmodic and sedative properties when taken internally. The 17th century herbalist John Gerard extolled the virtues of woundworts, while English botanist and herbalist Nicholas Culpeper, writing in the early 1600s, said that   (a   species, and therefore a woundwort in all but name)  which sounds credible until you read on Honeybees and bumblebees also like to visit the flowers of both Hedge Woundwort and Marsh Woundwort; this, when the two species are growing in close proximity, can as a result of cross pollination and so produce woundwort hybrids.  , the genus name, means 'spike of flowers', and plants in this genus do indeed produce flowers in spike form.

Other common names for Hedge Woundwort include Red Archangel, Common Hedge Nettle, and Grass Nettle. Marsh Woundwort is similar in stature and form but has paler flowers and unstalked leaves; the leaves of Hedge Woundwort are stalked.

The flowers are typically 2 to 3 cm in\n        diameter.       Stems of Greater Stitchwort are quite brittle but strong enough to support the flowers in all but the wildest of spring gales. The grey-green leaves are narrow and pointed, looking very much like some kind of grass - until the flower stems appear to confirm the identity.  This wildflower is widespread and very common throughout Britain and Ireland. Greater Stitchwort can be found in northern and central mainland European countries, too.   Like its relative  ,Greater Stitchwort does not appreciate waterlogged sites, and so in some of thewettest areas it is mainly confined to slopes.

Greater stitchwort begins flowering in late March and continues through tothe end of June and sometimes well into July, although mid April to mid May is when their finest floral displays generally occur.  Why this lovely wildflower should ever have been given the alternative and very derogatory common name of Poor Man's Buttonhole is hard to fathom.

The first new leaves appear during winter, before many other edible wild plants are available. In the distant past   was used in many herbal remedies, but nowadays other plants are generally considered superior. (We strongly advise against eating or using as medicines any plants without first obtaining qualified professional advice.)  The generic botanical name   comes from the Greek word  , which means myrrh. It suggests that the smells of Alexanders and of myrrh may be similar.The specific epithet   comes from the Latin  , a garden herb, and - , black - referring to the seeds.  The pictures of Alexanders shown on this page were taken in West Wales during April."},

The two species cope well in overlapping habitats and so are often seen growing together. Up to a metre in height, these hairy perennials stalkless upper hairy leaves in opposite pairs. The leaves are entire (not toothed) and oval with pointed tips, and  near the base of the plant they have unwinged stalks. Flowers of White Campion grow in clusters and each flower has five bi-lobed white petals forming a corolla 2.5 to 3cm across. The calyx is long and inflated but much narrower than in Sea Campion and Bladder campion - the two other white   species found in the wild in Britain and Ireland.  \n       A mainly lowland perennial, White Campion is less frequently encountered than Red Campion   in western Britain and Ireland but it is more widespread and common in eastern England.  Found throughout central and southern Europe, but much rarer in Scandinavia,   is also present in the   region of Portugal and in northern Africa.  White Campion is a naturalised introduction to North America, where it is now found in the wild in most states of the USA.  In areas where thereare both Red Campion and White Campion are present you may occasionally find what appear to be White Campion plants with pale pink flowers; these are simply hybrids of the two species. \n       This creamy white member of the   genus often grows on waste ground, disturbed roadside verges and arrable field margins that are well drained. Unlike Red Campion, this species shows a marked preference for alkaline to neutral soils. In southern Portugal and parts of central Europe we have also come across White Campion just inside deciduous and mixed woodland, but more often in hot southern climates this is a woodland edge species.  In Britain and Ireland the first flowers of White Campion appear in May, and displays are at their best through June and July with a few flowers usually lasting through to the end of September and the occasional straggler still evident in October. In southern Europe of course the first flowers appear much earlier - in late February or early March - and by the end of June the White Campion flowers are all dead as in all but the shadiest of sites the plants are shriveling up in the heat of high summer. Unlike many wildflowers, the flowers of White Campion remain open as dusk descends, at which time they are slightly scented and attract moths as pollinators. Plants of the genus   have roots that contain the compound saponin, which although a mildly toxic substance has long been used as soap for washing clothes, hair etc. There are also references to some kinds of campion being used to treat snake bites and as a cure for corns and warts. , the genus name, is a reference to the Greek woodland god Silenus the foster father of Bacchus, who was often depicted covered in a sticky foam and whose name in turn comes from the Greek word for saliva. (The female flowers of Red Campion   secrete a frothy foam that captures pollen from insects that come to the flowers to gather nectar.) The specific epithet   means 'with wide leaves' - and in the case of White Campion the leaves are generally wide in comparison with those of its close relative Red Campion.  Two other campions, Bladder Campion -   - and Sea Campion, are sometimes mistakenly identified as white campion. Bladder campion has branched flower stems and greatly enlarged sepal tubes (seed pods), while   -   is a short plant also with swolen sepal tubes but having unbranched flower stems each topped by a single bloom.

The pink flowers are 3 to 4cm across with five petals each deeply divided into four narrow lobes; this gives the flowers an untidy, ragged appearance - hence the common name Ragged Robin. Stems of Ragged Robin are hairy and can grow to 80cm in height, and the untoothed opposite leaves on the upper stems are stalkless, narrow and lanceolate, with a few spoon-shaped stalked leaves lower down. The leaves are rough to the touch. Although it is quite a common wildflower Ragged Robin is rather localised in Britain and Ireland. We have seen it in many parts of northern and central mainland Europe including  . Ragged Robin  usually inhabitats damp or marshy areas, although once established it seems able to grow surprisingly well even on some dry and exposed roadside verges. In  marshy locations this plant often spreads across large areas, but for the most part it is more sparselydistributed than its relative Red Campion.  In Britain and Ireland this lovely wildflower is in decline due to land drainage, which has destroyed much of its favoured marshy habitat.  This aptly named wildflower produces its ragged and often rather bedraggled-looking blooms mainly in May and June although a few flowers sometimes hang on in damp, shaded spots through July and sometimes into early August.  , the genus name, is a reference to the Greek woodland god Silenus the foster father of Bacchus, who was often depicted covered in a sticky foam and whose name in turn comes from the Greek word for saliva.  , the former genus name, comes from the Greek noun  , meaning lamp; it refers to the use of a plant in this genus as the wick of an oil lamp. The specific epithet   means 'flower of the cuckoo' and was probably chosen because the first flowers of Ragged Robin appear just as the first cuckoos are being heard (in Britain and Ireland at least) in May. Ragged Robin is sometimes planted beside garden ponds for its ornamental value. Seen on the left is the display of Ragged Robin beside our own small garden pond in West Wales; the photograph was taken in June 2014. The roots of these wildflowers are a source of saponin, a soap substitute than can be used for washing clothes or as a shampoo etc. Saponin is toxic, although not readily absorbed by the human body; it affects some creatures more than others and has in the past been used by hunters (and probably poachers) to stun or even to kill fish in ponds and small streams.  Occasionally you may come across an all-white variety of Ragged Robin, but pale to mid pink is more normal.  From a distance Ragged Robin is easily mistaken for Red Campion  , which has broader petals each with a single narrow cleft. Red campion grows in generally drier habitats such as under hedgerows and on woodland edges.   is a Mediterranean species with smaller pink flowers that are more deeply notched; it also has a less robust growing habit and favours dry sandy soil. Most of the pictures of Ragged Robin shown on this page were taken in June in   in Anglesey, North Wales,   in Pembrokeshire, Crosshands in Carmarthenshire, Rhydlewis in Ceredigion, and in May in Slovenia.

Nottingham Catchfly has ascending, branched stems up to about 60cm tall that are  hairy and, towards the flowering region, glandularly sticky; the sticky protuberances on the upper stems serve to deter small non-flying invertebrates from feeding on the flowers. The flowers of     are carried in a one-sided spike. The nodding flowers, which have five deeply bifurcated white or pale pink petals, are 1.5 to 2.5 cm in diameter; they have a distinctive narrow calyx which is green and patterned with ten longitudinal purple stripes. The petals usually (although there are occasional exceptions) curl up during the daytime and open out at night, at which time they emit a sweet-smelling odour that attracts pollinators; this is a feature shared with many other catchfly species.       This perennial wildflower is found in scattered locations in England, Wales and Scotland, but it is an uncommon to rare find.

Up to 30cm in height, these perennial wildflowers form low, broad cushion-like plants. Sea Campion has hairless grey-green waxy leaves which are lanceolate, stalkless and in opposite pairs on the grey-green stems.  Each with five bi-lobed petals, the flowers range from 2 to 3cm across and either pure white or white with a hint of pink or mauve. Flowers are borne usually singly or very few in a cluster and on upright stems, unlike othercampions which tend to produce many flower heads on one stem. Behind the corolla there is an inflated green-tinged fused calyx, which is five-lobed and lined with reddish-purple or reddish-brown veins. As with other member of the genus  , the unscented flowers are dioecious, which means that the male and female flowers occur on separate plants.  Sea Campion is found along much of the coast of Britain and Ireland and in a few low-lying inland locations on limestone habitats in north-west England and western Scotland.   is found on coastal cliffs from Scandinavia down to north-west Spain and Portugal and on Madeira.  Sea Campion is an introduced species in other parts of the world including Australia.  A plant of coastal cliffs, sand-dune systems and gravel banks, Sea Campion also occurs in a few localised lowland sites away from the coast, notably where thin soil overlays a limestone substrate. In Britain and Ireland the first flowers of Sea Campion appear in late March, and the floral displays are at their finest from late May (especially when interspersed with patches of Bluebells and Red Campion) until the end of June.  Flowering usually continues until late September and often  a few stragglers can be found well into October in sheltered coves. , the genus name, is a reference to the Greek woodland god Silenus the foster father of Bacchus, who was often depicted covered in a sticky foam and whose name in turn comes from the Greek word for saliva.

The sky blue star-like six-petalled flowers 1 to 1.5cm across grow in spikes of typically 6 to 10 flowers each with a dark blue bracts at the base. \n       Growing from bulbs, the curled basal leaves of Spring Squill are strap-like, varing in length from 2 to 15cm or so; they are typically 3.5cm wide. Spring Squill populations are in decline and these lovely plants can now only be found in Britain on the western coasts; they occur also on parts of the eastern coast of Ireland. Beside the coastal paths of West Wales you will findthese pretty spring flowers on dry grassy slopes. The best place to look for Spring Squill is short-sward coastal grassland that has not been disturbed by cultivation or treated with artificial fertillisers.

Occasionally Spring Squill can befound also in grassy areas away from the coast. \n       Spring Squill blooms from March to August but is usually at its best in April and May.

A distinguishing feature of this plant is the shape of its leaves, which are very deeply lobed, often with cuts almost to the central vein. Box-shaped and usually oblong in side view, hardly tapering at all, the flower heads of Cut-leaved Selfheal with their white flowers are very distinctive. The individual two-lobed flowers are 10 to 15mm long. The upper lip is a helmet-like cowl, while the lower lip is divided into three lobes, the central lobe longer than the two side lobes.     is localised in Britain, where it is found in a few sites mainly in southern England and southeast Wales, and it has been seen recently in at least one site in Ireland. This species is native to northern and central mainland Europe, and it is recorded as an introduced alien species in some eastern states of the USA, parts of South America, and south-east Australia.  Selfheal is tolerant of poor soils and grows in meadows, hedgerows and ditches. This rapid coloniser of wasteland will persist even in grassy paths, lawns and public parks that are subject to frequent walking.

Cowslips begin to produce their first pair of rolled-back leaves in early spring. As they and several subsequent young leaves develop they unroll and begin to look very similar to Primrose leaves, equally wrinkled, although shorter and rounder. The big difference is that Cowslip leaves form rosettes that lie almost flat on the ground. \n   From the centre of the leaf rosette a flower stalk up to 25cm tall arises, at the top of which several individual short-stalked flowers spring from a single point to form a pendent umbel. The number of flowers in an umbel is very variable, but a typical mature plant in suitable habitat might produce a cluster of 10 to 30 elongated bell-shaped flowers, each 8 to 15mm across. Most Cowslips have yellow flowers, but very occasionally, as seen below, you may also come across red-flowered Cowslips in the wild. The Cowslip is widespread throughout Britain and Ireland except for the far north. Although in many parts of Britain and Ireland they are less common than the Primroses, to which they are closely related,  \n   Cowslips are found in most parts of Northern and Central Europe. For example   is particularly rich in members of the family Primulaceae, having  , Common Primrose and  , too. Appearing a little later than   but overlapping their blooming period, Cowslips are among the best known of the spring wildflowers. In many parts of Northern Europe you will see fields and roadside verges swathed in bobbing\n  Cowslip heads in April, May and June. Slightly alkaline to slightly acid soil seems to suit Cowslips best, but they do need plenty of light and do not thrive in woodlands except beside tracks or in clearings. In meadows these plants areeasily destroyed by over-cropping of the grass in spring. Cowslips can occur in vast colonies once they are settled into a suitable habitat, such as steep motorway banks and roadside verges, provided the land remains largely undisturbed during the growing and flowering season.. \n   This lovely wildflower is greatly prized for its perfume, and so not surprisingly it is used in the perfume industry. The flowers are also collected to make Cowslip wine.  Cowslips are pollinated by insects. They are the larval host plant for the rare  , as well as an important nectar source for bees and many other kinds of  . In his   (1753), the Famous Swedish biologist Carl Linnaeus adopted a broad species concept, recognising the Cowslip, Oxlip and Primrose as one species,  , with three varieties - var.  , var.   and var.   covering the Cowslip, Oxlip and Primrose respectively. Linnaeus is, however, formally credited with establishing the scientific name of the Cowslip as  \n   The common name Cowslip may come from cow slop, because these plants can sometimes be seen growing at the edges of well-rotted patches of cow dung. Another suggestion is that Cowslip might a corruption of the Old English Cow's Leak meaning cow's plant. The generic     comes from the Latin  , meaning first - a reference to the early appearance of flowers in this genus and Primroses in particular. It is from Latin that we get the specific epithet  , meaning  . Cowslips hybridise readily with   and other members of the   genus. A very common sight in the wild where both Cowslips and Primroses grow is the False Oxlip (   ).

A perennial, the Primrose produces neat hemispherical clumps typically 10 to 25 cm tall. The rosette of basal leaves is often visible right through the winter except in exposed locations. The short-stemmed leaves can grow to 20cm or so in length, and their wrinkled surfaces and crinkly or slightly toothed margins are quite distinctive. \n   Flowers, each with five notched petals, are typically 2 to 4cm in diameter, pale yellow with a deeper yellow or orange-yellow centre, and slightly scented. Each flower is usually borne singly on a slender stem. Flowers may have a long prominent style, as shown above, in which case they are known as pin flowers or pin-eye flowers; or the style may be shorter and the stamens most prominent - an example is shown below - when they are referred to as thrum flowers or thrum-eye flowers.  Primrose flowers are hermaphrodite. Fertilisation is usually achieved between a thrum-eye flower and a pin-eye flower; pollination from pin to pin or thrum to thrum is not generally effective. Most of the flies of early spring are very small and tend to go unnoticed, but they have no difficulty finding Primroses and helping with their pollination. \n   Widespread throughout Britain and Ireland, Primroses are native to the British Isles. They do not cope well with prolonged dry conditions, and so in parts of south-east England in particular Primroses seem to be becoming increasingly scarce, probably not helped at all by the effects of climate change. Primroses are also found in some parts of mainland Europe, although in Scandinavia   are much more common. (  has Cowslips,   and  , too.) Although localised, Primroses occur also in North Africa and in parts of western Asia.  In mild winters, Primroses can appear before Christmas in southern Britain, but they are usually at their best in March and April and continue blooming well into May or early June. These lovely perennial wildflowers favour heavy clay soils and damp shady habitats; as a result they are most abundant in broadleaf woodlands and beneath hedgerows; indeed, you will often find these shallow-rooting plants in greatest abundance at the edge of a wood or on a tree-lined riverbank where they receivesome light but the surface soil never dries out completely. Where the grass is not cropped too closely Primroses can carpet large areas of  motorway embankments and sloping damp meadows . (Steep slopes are usually spared when artificial fertilisers are spread, and so the wildflowers are less likely to be crowded out by rank vegetation.) In 1753 Carl Linnaeus called the Primrose  . English botanist William Hudson (1734 - 1793) established its currently-accepted scientific name   in a 1762 publication.  Not all primroses are yellow, even in the wild. Some have almost pure white flowers while others have a pink or purplish tinge. These mauve specimens were seen in Cenarth Woods in the Teifi Valley in West Wales during April.\n   The common name Primrose comes from the Latin  , meaning first rose. They are one of the first of the rose-like flowers to appear, but the name seems incongruous since Primroses do not belong to the rose family, Rosaceae. The scientific name reflects the early appearance of this flower in its genus name  , while the specific epithet   is Latin and means common.  We are fortunate that this lovely wildflower is still fairly common in Britain, but it is a rare sight in many otger parts of Europe. (One of the common names of this species is English Primrose!)    Near conurbations its is likely that pinkish Primroses are cultivars that have escaped from gardens (or have been thrown out). In the past Primrose were thought to be a powerful medicine for treating painful conditions such as muscular rheumatism, paralysis and gout; the leaves were used to dress wounds; and the flowers are considered edible and were once popular in the dish known as Primrose Pottage. An infusion of the petals makes Primrose Tea.  We strongly advise against eating or using as medicines any plants without first obtaining qualified professional advice. Cowslips,  , are sometimes mistaken for Primroses.  Primroses hybridise readily with Cowslips  and other members of the   genus. A very common sight in the wild where both Cowslips and Primroses grow is the False Oxlip,  often wrongly identified as  , the true Oxlip which in Britain is found only locally in south-east England. In the picture above, taken at the edge of a steeply-sloping field in Pembrokeshire, west Wales, Primroses and False Oxlips are growing side by side; however, Cowslips were also seen nearby.

This lovely spring flower also occurs in  , where we found a few stragglers still in bloom on the snow line of the Julian Alps in mid June 2014. The Oxlip likes damp conditions including woodlands and woodland edges; it flowers from early spring onwards but the greater the altitude the later the flowers tend to appear. In Britain true Oxlips bloom from April to June.  The specific epithet   means tall - a reference to the erect stature of the plants, which are usually taller than Primroses  . The Oxlip is the county wildflower of Suffolk, which is home to most of Britain's wild Oxlip population.  Oxlips could be confused with Primroses   or with Cowslips  , both of which can occur in the kinds of habitats that Oxlips   grow in. Not strictly a species but a hybrid, the False Oxlip can look remarkably similar to a true Oxlip, although generally its umbels of flowers are not so obviously one sided. It is when Cowslips and Primroses hybridise that the resulting offspring are False Oxlips. In this example (above) from the Teifi Valley in West Wales, the plant on the left is a Primrose and on the right a False Oxlip. (Note that the umbel of flowers is not one sided.) Primroses and Cowslips were plentiful on the same slope.  The False Oxlips shown above were found in southern Scotland. Very occasionally Primroses can also produce flowers in umbels rather than one per flower stalk, and then they too can be confused with Oxlips, especially if nearby shading or exposure to prevailing winds results in one-sided umbels of flowers."},

It may seem surprising that this flower, which is native to alpine regions of central and southern Europe and was  introduced to Britain and Ireland in the early part of the seventeenth century as a garden plant, has become so widely naturalised. \n       Fox and Cubs is a colourful perennial that spreads by seed and by means of stolons (runners) and shallow rhizomes. Plants usually grow to between 20 and 40cm in height, and the orange flowers are between 1 and 2.5cm in diameter. A key distinguishing feature (in addition to the orange colour of the flowers) is the presence of blackish hairs that cover the stems and, in particular, the young flower buds. At the base of each shallow-rooting plant is a rosette of hairy oval to lanceolate leaves from the centre of which the flower stem arises, bearing a tight cluster of up to 12 or occasionally more flowers on very short pedicels (stalks). Usually the flowers are bright orange, but sometimes they are a very pale orange, almost pure yellow.; then identification is much more of a challenge.  \n       Most common in central and southern Britain but also recorded in Ireland, Fox-and-cubs is an introduced invasive species not only in temperate parts of Europe and Asia but also in Australia, New Zealand, Tasmania and North America.  Often found on stony waste land, in churchyards on roadside embankments and beside railway tracks, despite efforts to eradicate it this fast-spreading wildflower has also become a permanent feature of many parks and gardens. In Britain and Ireland Fox-and-cubs produces its first flowers in June, providing a welcome burst of colour after many of our native wildflowers have died back. Flowering continues through summer and autumn, usually at least until October.  \n       Although lovely on roadside banks, this fast-spreading hawkweed can be a terribly difficult weed to control when it gets in to gardens. , the generic name, means 'with small hairs', while the specific epithet   means orange. This is a hairy plant with orange flowers, so the scientific name   is perfectly descriptive.  Fox and Cubs has many other common names including Tawny Hawkweed, Devil's Paintbrush Grim-the-collier (because the black hairs are reminiscent of a miner covered in colliery grime), and Orange Hawkbit. It is alleged that hawks eat these wildflowers and that this is the reason for their superb eyesight.  In older field guides this plant may be listed under its synonymous scientific name  . Other members of the hawkweed group include  ; there are also many hawkbits and hawksbeards, all of which havedandelion-like flowers.

There are very many species of hawkweeds, and   is a complex of many species with numerous subspecies, varieties and forms. Separating the various yellow hawkweed species requires specialist knowledge and much patience. Mouse-ear Hawkweed is a hairy perennial perennial plant, with a distinctive basal rosette of oval untoothed leaves whose undersides are covered in dense whitish glandular hairs. The leafless stem, typically up to 25cm tall but occasionally reaching to 50cm, bears a single lemon yellow flower head 2 to 3cm in diameter whose outer rays ('petals' as some people losely term them) have red or orange-red undersides.  New plants form at the ends of runners, which then decay so that the parent plant is no longer attached to the clones that it has produced vegetatively. As with other hawkweeds, Mouse-ear Hawkweed also propagates by seeds. This lovely hawkweed is common and widespread throughout Britain and Ireland, and its native range extends through mainland Europe into parts of Asia..  On dryish roadside verges and grassy banks, particularly the slopes of vegetated coastal sand dunes. In Britain and Ireland the flowers of Mouse-ear Hawkweed can be seen from May to October, but they are  usually at their best in mid summer. The pictures shown on this page were taken between the end of May and late August. Looking rather like small dandelion heads, the seed heads of Mouse-ear Hawkweed contain many seeds, known as achenes, each of which is attached to a parachute-like pappus. As with dandelion clocks, the seeds are dispersed during windy weather. The genus name   means 'with small hairs' - a reference to the hairy leaves - while the specific epithet   refers to a workshop and hence implies that this herb was used in the production of food or medicine.    an orange hawkweed, is also abundant in the UK, and can create a spectacular roadside display in high summer."},

It is an introduced species in North America.  You will find plenty of Redshank in marshy areas, although it is also quite commonly seen in dryareas where the ground has been disturbed - building sites, for example. In Britain and Ireland Redshank blooms from June through to October. Generally considered a nuisance weed of cultivated land, Redshank has been used as a source of a yellowish dye.

Like many members of the borage family of plants, the buds of Green Alkanet flowers are pink, and it is not until they open fully that they become the startling blue colour that always catches our eye as we drive along country lanes. The plant is naturalised in the UK having arrived here from southern Europe. The name alkanet comes from the arabic name for henna, and the roots of Green Alkanet can be used to produce a red dye.

The flowers appear before the leaves, and as summer approaches the flowers decay while the leaves continue to grow bigger, eventually looking rather like rhubarb - as a result this member of the asteraceae family of flowers is also sometimes referred to as Bog Rhubarb. Fowering spikes emerge from the ground in March before the leaves appear, and the flowers persist through April and often well in to May. The toothed, heart-shaped leaves  usually emerge in early May and continue growing until late summer, by which time they can be up to a metre across. Although matt or felt-like and mid green on their upper surfaces, the leaves have light-grey and distinctly hairy undersides. Male and female flowers occur on separate plants (so this is a dioecious species, literally meaning 'having two houses'); however, in Britain it seems that female plants are quite a rarity. We are grateful to Patrick Gibb, who informed us that the explanation usually given for this unequal distribution is that beekeepers planted the males around the country as a valuable source of early nectar and pollen. Female inflorescences can be up to 70cm tall, while male plants are reported to be much shorter and more squat on average and with more densely-packed flowerheads. Each floret comprises typically 15 to 25 individual  five-petalled pink flowers. Most often seen in damp, shaded places such as wet meadows, damp woodlands, stream banks and ditches, Butterbur is particularly conspicuous when it colonises disturbed roadside verges and marshy waste land. Petasites hybridus is native to much of northern and central Europe including Britain and Ireland, where it is quite a common sight. It's range (possibly due to introduction) extends as far north as Finland and southwards into Spain. To the east the range of this species extends into much of Asia In Britain and Ireland Butterbur produces its flowers from March to May.  The common name Butterbur comes from a past use of the leaves - as a protective wrapping for butter. Bees is particular benefit from this nectar-rich wildflower because it blooms early in the year when few other wildflowers are in flower. An introduced species,  , is very similar but has white flowers. Another, earlier-blooming wildflower with which Butterbur is sometimes confused is Winter Heliotrope,  ; as its scientific name suggests, this is a scented flower, whereas Butterbur has no discernible scent. The other obvious difference is that there are far fewer flowers on the lax spikes of Winter Heliotrope, whose leaves are much smaller than those of Butterbur.

This is a dioecious species, and RHS states that only male plants occur in Britain, so I think they must all be genetically identical clones. In Britain and Ireland Winter Heliotrope produces its flowers from November to February.  Winter Heliotrope has a pleasant vanilla-like fragrance (although some say it smells more like cherry pie!), but because it tends to be invasive in areas of disturbed soil it is not popular with most gardeners.

Common throughout the central and eastern parts of Britain and Ireland, the Common Poppy is less plentiful in the north of England and in Scotland. This striking wildflower occurs throughout most of mainland Europe, northern Africa and much of Asia. Popies love disturbed soil. There can be few lovelier sights than a cornfield with swathes of poppies... and sad to say few rarer sights in most parts of Britain nowadays. Poppies are still plentiful on some motorway cuttings, and they can spring up anywhere that light, sandy soil has been recently disturbed. In Europe (and in the Mediterranean region in particular) where less intensive farming regimes are used, it is still common to see fields full of poppies. The Common Poppy sprang up in profusion on the battlefields of World War II, most particularly in France and Belgium, and has great significance in remembrance of the fallen soldiers. In Britain the Common Poppy usually produces flowers from June until August, but in southern Europe this wildflower can appear as early as February.

The plant is entirely lacking in chlorophyll (green pigment) which means that, unlike green plants, it is unable to make (photosynthesise) food from sunlight. It is entirely dependent for nutrients to germinate and grow on a host mycorrhizal fungus in the soil which is, in turn, dependent upon attachments to the trees in the woodland. Since all parties involved in this relationship survive it is clearly of mutual benefit. The resulting drab brownish-beige colour of the entire orchid plant often makes it difficult to locate in the dark, wooded habitats where it lives. The orchids grow to a height of around 40cm, and when they emerge from the soil in springtime, the flowerbuds are fully formed and tightly sheathed in bracts which gradually release as the flower spikes grow.  Bird's-nest Orchid is in steep decline due to loss of suitable deciduous woodland habitat which has either been eradicated altogether or converted to faster-growing cash-crop conifer woodlands. In areas where thousands of plants were once recorded only a few now remain. Its world range extends into Northern and Central Europe and further south towards the Mediterranean where it is largely confined to to mountain woodlands and forests. In  at the right time of year, these orchids appear in thousands. Not only are they inside woodland, they spill out on to roadside verges in huge clumps of flowers. No doubt, they occur in similar numbers in other Central European countries, too.  This orchid occurs in Deep leaf litter in dark woodland habitats, and also in open woodland rides. The specimens shown on this page were found under lime trees in west Wales in early May (top), and in Beech woods in the  in France in late April. In the UK and Ireland Bird's-nest Orchids usually flower from early May to late June. The genus name   means 'nest',a reference to the tangled root structure of orchids in this genus.

Bogbean is a most distinctive plant, especially when it is in bloom. Long, thick stems bear trifoliate leaves that individually look like the leaves of Broad Beans, and this, together with its propensity for growing in boggy ground, may well be the origin of the common name.  Delicate and star shaped, the flowers of Bogbean have an amazingly intricate structure, which becomes apparent only when they are fully open. Buds of Bogbean are pink, as initially are the undersides of flower petals, but the flowers become almost pure white when they are fully open. Each individual flower has five (or very occasionally six) narrow pointed petals that are fringed along most of both edges by distinctive sprays of long white whiskers.The stems that bear the pyramidal spikes of flowers can extend to between 15 and 30cm above the surface, so that the flowers are clearly visible from quite a distance. Bogbean is widespread in Britain and Ireland. This wetland wildflower is also found throughout most of northern and central Europe. (We have seen it, for example, in Triglav National Park, in  .)  Bogbean thrives in wet acidic soil. These plants thrive in shallow, low-nutrient pools, peat bogs and marshes, but any permanently damp depression in moorland is likely to be colonised by Bogbean. The leaves and flowers all show above the surface, but propagation is largely via the thick sprawling stems that extend just below the surface of the soil or, when immersed, just under the surface of the water. The stems root at nodes and produce new flowering shoots, particularly where they make contact with wet peaty land. In Britain the first flowers of Bogbean appear in March and are usually at their best in April, and in lowland sites by early May the flowers are over. In the Scottish highlands Bogbean can still be seen in flower in early June. The generic name   probably comes from the Greek  , meaning disclosing, and anthos, meaning flower. This is assumed to be a reference to the fact that the individual flowers in the inflorescence open sequentially, starting at the bottom of the pyramid and ending with disclosure (revelation!) of the terminal flower, In the past Bogbean was a popular medicinal herb and considered to be particularly valuable as a treatment for scurvy. Nowadays Menyanthes trifoliata is valued more for its ornamental value in and beside garden ponds. Bogbean is the county flower of Renfrewshire. Bogbean is the only member of the   genus and is unlikely to be confused with any other white-flowered species. Its nearest lookalike is probably Fringed Water-lily  , which despite its common name is not really a 'water-lily' but the only other member of the family Menyanthes.

The untoothed pinnate leaves are not truly trefoils, as they have in fact five leaflets rather than three. The tip of the leafstalk bears three clover-like leaflets, but there are two more leaflets where the leafstalk joins the stem. (Stems are solid, not hollow, and this is an important identifying feature.) Slipper-shaped in side view, the yellow flowers, each typically 10 to 16mm long, are are borne in tightly-packed heads of between two and seven. Each flower has five petals, although that is not immediately obvious; one petals stands upright, two more form the wings, and a further two smaller petals are united to form what is known as a keel. This plant is sometimes referred to as ''Bacon and Eggs\" because of its red-and-yellow colouring as the flowers are opening. Once fully open, the flowers become more of a uniform yellow, sometimes retaining patches tinged faintly with orange or red. As with other members of the family Fabaceae, seed pods of Bird's-foot Trefoil are long and narrow, usually held in bunches three or more that look (so it has been suggested) rather like the claw-like feet of birds. Each pod holds several seeds (peas, of course!), and as they dry the pods twist and then split to release their seeds.  Common throughout Britain and Ireland, Bird's-foot Trefoil can be found in all mainland European countries, too. In   this colourful wildflower is a common sight on roadside verges and in the meadows. Bird's-foot Trefoil is found in all sorts of well-drained grassland,including wasteland, roadside verges, churchyards, lawns and parks; it even grown on some sandy riverbanks. The first flowers of Bird's-foot Trefoil usually appear in late April or early May, and blooming continues until mid September.  Agricultural cultivars of Bird's-foot Trefoil are planted for forage, but to the insect world the flowers are of even greater value, as they are a great source of nectar. Bees love them. Some butterflies and moths uses   as their larval food plants.  , the genus name, may come from a Greek word, but it refers to an entirely different plant! The specific epithet   comes from Latin and means 'with small horns'. Greater Bird's-foot Trefoil   is taller and grows in damp grassland. Its stems are hollow whereas the stems of   are solid.  The photographs of Bird's-foot Trefoil shown on this page were taken in Wales during May and June."},

This deciduous climber has oval grey-green leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers in flat clusters. The flowers vary in colour from white or yellow through to pink or red. Honeysuckle is common throughout the UK and Ireland.  Honeysuckle is a clockwise climber and can rapidly cover trees up to six metres tall. Honeysuckle can be seen in flower between late May and the end of October, and it is quite common to see the red fruit berries alongside fresh Honeysuckle blooms during late summer and autumn.

The plants in South Wales are referred to by some as   var.   because of slight morphological differences (the leaves are broader, more oval and slightly hooded at the tip) although genetic studies have revealed little or no difference between them.  This orchid occurs throughout the temperate zone of Europe and also in temperate and boreal North America.  Altough sand dunes and permanently wet marshland would appear to be very different habitats they both offer the two basic requirements of the Fen Orchid; short sward grassland and very wet (for at least part of the year) ground containing high levels of calcium. Fens differ from bogs because they are fed by water which has high levels of alkalinity (bogs are acidic), and in the case of Wales, the soil in the sand dune slacks is comprised largely of crushed shell particles and are submerged in water during the winter.  By far the larger part of the British population is to be found in the dune slacks of South Wales at   where up to 90% of the total UK number can be found. Originally found in a number of coastal sand dune sites along the South Wales coast, the Fen Orchid is now extinct in all of them except Kenfig.   Kenfig National Nature Reserve now has an ongoing programme to protect the Fen Orchid, and CCW  (Countryside Council for Wales), now part of Natural Resources Wales, is working in partnership with Kenfig staff to  improve the habitat at the nature reserve. There is already a programme of close  mowing being carried out each year to simulate the effects of animal grazing  necessary for the orchids' survival, but now it is proposed to create new dune  slacks in the hope that the orchids will colonise them. This five year programme commenced in 2009.  The threat to the Fen Orchid population at Kenfig National Nature  Reserve was identified during the 1990s, and it is hoped that colonisation of  the new dune slacks by the fen orchid will take place within 10 years of the  start of the programme. The scheme is to be monitored throughout by CCW. Meanwhile, at Cambridge University Botanic Garden there is an ongoing programme to try and harvest the mycorrhizal fungus whose presence in the soil is essential for the germination and growth of Fen Orchid seeds. Once this fungus has been captured it will enable the team to grow Fen Orchids from seed and study their ecology in greater depth. If successful the project could enable them to grow Fen Orchids in protected areas for subsequent reintroduction to the wild.  Like the Common Twayblade   to which the Fen orchid is related it is hard to spot as it blends in so well with the other plants to be found in the same area. It seldom grows taller than 25 cm, normally has two broad leaves (again like the Twayblade) and typically three to six distinctive greenish-yellow flowers.  This tiny orchid comes into flower in early June and can persist until the beginning of July.

Unlike other dead-nettles, the toothed, heart-shaped finely-hairy leaves of Red Dead-nettle are all stalked, including those just above and below the flower whorl. The stems and upper leaves turn purplish, and those immediately below and above the flower whorl usually turn a strikingly deep purple. Flowers of Red Dead-nettle vary from pink to deep reddish-purple; they are two-lipped and 10 to 18mm long, forming a loosely-packed whorl around the stalk near its apex. The flowers are hermaphrodite - having both male and female organs - and they are pollinated mainly by bees.  This low growing annual is very common in throughout Britain and Ireland. Red Dead-nettle is also common in northern and central mainland European countries including  . Found mainly on field margins, on disturbed wasteland, and beside country footpaths and hedgerows, this wayside wildflower is also quite a common sight in country churchyards. In Britain and Ireland   blooms from March right through to October but is at its (rarely spectacular) best during springtime. This is often the first member of Mint family (Lamiaceae) to come in to flower, and in South Wales we have even seen it as early as February. The young leaves are edible and can be used either raw in salads or cooked with other vegetables. Herbal uses of Red Dead-nettle exploit its reported astringent, diuretic, purgative and styptic properties; in the past poultices made from fresh bruised leaves were used to dress wounds. , the genus name, is the Latin word for Dead-nettle; however, plants of this family were once known as Labiatae, and   means lips. The distinctive two-lipped flowers of the Lamiaceae are sometimes referred to as bi-labiate. As you would expect, the specific epithet   refers to the colour of the upper leaves (and sometimes the flowers too). White Dead-nettle   has, as the name implies, whitish flowers, and its leaves remain green. Yellow Archangel   has yellow flowers.  The Red Dead-nettle plants shown on this page were photographed in West Wales during March."},

The hooded pink flowers are 3 to 5 cm long, and the stems are increasingly redder towards to top of the plants. Broadly lanceolate leaves are prominently veined and grow in pairs up the hollow stems. Equally described as a blessing that brightens up otherwise boring urban water courses or as a conservationist's nightmare, this is a visitor that has a future in our countryside when many feel it has already outstayed its welcome! In spring tiny seedlings emerge, and at that time they are most easily destroyed by pulling them out and burning them. The attractive flowers (sometimes called 'poor-man's orchids') appear in July, and by October their ripe pods have burst, scattering seeds not only around the plant but also onto the water. That is why control is only feasible by starting in the headwater streams and working down to the estuary... a mammoth task. Some think that the flowers have an attractive scent whilst others find it nauseating, but it is late in the season when the seed-heads are exploding that the plants smell at their worst and give off an obnoxious 'oily' smell that is particularly noticeable late in the evenings - a most unpleasant accompaniment to a night's sea trout fishing!

Bluebells can be seen in bloom from late April to June, with the most spectacular displays in May. In the evenings the air is scented with the fragrance of these delicate flowers, which droop so quickly when picked. Picking Bluebells, once a popular spring activity, is now discouraged because the plants can so easily be killed - and they are poisonous! Experts now advise that picking the flowers does not do much damage, but if the leaves of Bluebells are picked or trodden down then the plant may die. (The flowers do not make good cut blooms for the house, as they wilt almost immediately after they are picked.) The shiny black teardrop-shaped seeds remain in their cases through summer and into autumn; then they fall to the ground and are soon buried beneath rotting dead leaves. Bluebells can be found throughout Britain and Ireland and they occure across most of Western Europe; however, Britain is by far the best place for seeing them. It is estimated that nearly 50% of the world's population of these gregarious spring wildflowers occur in Britain and Ireland. \n       Pink, mauve and (as seen above) white 'bluebells' are also fairly common in the countryside, and particularly near to towns and villages. These are not necessarily native Bluebells; many are garden escapes - cultivars derived from southern European bluebell species such as the Spanish Bluebell  , which has a more erect stature, shorter bells than our native Bluebells and greenish or blueish pollen. Hybridisation with these alien species is considered to be one of the most serious threats to the conservation of Britain's wild Bluebell populations.         The Bluebell flowers shown on this page were photographed in woodlands in West Wales."},

Some people eat the fresh leaves of Herb Robert in salads; and in the past both the leaves and the flowers have been used to make tea. When crushed the fresh leaves smell like burning spices or, some say, tyre rubber, and when rubbed on the skin it is said to act as a mosquito repellent.

As with other wild geraniums the stems tend to redden towards the end of the flowering season. Individual flowers are 3 to 4cm across with five unnotched petals and five short pointed hairy sepals. Each flower has ten stamens and a pistil of five fused carpels. Borne usually in pairs on axilliary flower stalks, the flowers produce five-sectioned seed capsules with beak-like tips. Meadow Crane's-bill is found in greatest abundance in the east of and south of England, although it can also be found right in the north of Scotland. In Scandinavia, where this flower is widespread and common, it is called the Mid-summer Flower (Midsommar Blomster) because it can always be relied upon to be flowering in time for the Mid-summer celebrations - a far more important festival in those cold countries than Christmas!

Common and widespread in Britain and Ireland, Meadowsweet is native to Europe and western Asia and has been introduced to other parts of the world including North America, where it has become naturalised.  At its best in sunlit places beside ditches, pondsand streams, Meadowsweet is also commonly seen on roadside verges and woodland edges as well as in damp meadows. In Britain and Ireland Meadowsweet has an long flowering season, beginning in late May or early June and often continuing well in to October.  The flowers of Meadowsweet contain a high concentration of salicylic acid. This is the compound from which the pain-relieving (analgesic) drug Aspirin (active ingredient acetylsalicylic acid) was initially derived, and it was given that name because at the time the generally-accepted scientific name for Meadowsweet was   - hence aSPIRin.  The purified form of Aspirin was first produced in 1897, but salicylic acid from plants has a much longer herbal history. Not surprisingly, Meadowsweet has long been used in herbal medicines to treat headaches and gastric upsets.  comes from the Latin noun  , a thread, and the Latin adjective   which means hanging - a reference to the way that the underground tubers hang upon fibrous thread-like roots. The specific epithet   is a reference to elm trees (  species), whose wrinkled leaves are similar to the leaflets of Meadowsweet. The common name Meadowsweet suggests that this is a sweet-smelling wildflower that grows in meadows, and so it is; however, another of its common mead is Meadsweet, reflecting the fact that the flowers are used, notably in Scandinavia, in the brewing of mead.  is a smaller, less common plant and tolerates drier habitats than Meadowsweet.

Snowdrops have narrow strap-like leaves almost as tall as the flower stalks. They grow to between 8 and 16cm tall, each bulb producing a pair of grey-green leaves and a smooth, leafless scape bearing a bract and a single flower bud sheathed, initially, by a papery membrane.  The campanulate (bell-shaped) flowers are pendulous, opening to reveal three large white outer sepals and three smaller notched green-veined inner petals. Enclosed by the inner petals are six pollen-bearing anthers. Occasionally we come across flowers with four petals and sepals. After pollination, the ovary ripens to produce a three-sectioned seed capsule within which are tiny off-white seeds containing chemicals attractive to ants. The ants carry away the seeds but do not eat the part containing the seed germ; in this remasrkable way Snowdrops are able to colonise new territory Like other members of the Amaryllidaceae, Snowdrops are also able to multiply via bulbils and to reach new territory when rain washes the shallow-rooting bulbs from disturbed soil and transports them during floods - see the note below.  Widespread throughout the UK except in the very far north of Scotland, Snowdrops are mainly naturalised in the countryside having escaped from gardens. It is just possible that Snowdrops, which are known to be native to parts of southern Europe - from the Iberian Peninsula eastwards to the Ukraine are - are truly native to some parts of southern England.  It had been thought that the Romans introduced Snowdrops to Britain, but experts now believe they arrived in the early sixteenth century. Certainly by the time John Gerald was writing his   (first published in 1597) this spring flower had made its way to England and was described by Gerard, and in the second edition of 1633 he referred to it by the common name Snowdrop.  Because they like shade, Snowdrops rarely colonise open meadows, preferring to cling to the\n    edges of fields and damp woods, where trees or bushes provide shelter from the sun. Not surprisingly, western parts of Britain, which have more cloudy spring days, have some spectacular displays of Snowdrops. (Most of the plants shown on this page were photographed in West Wales.)  The reason why Snowdrops are so common along watercourses is that bulbils become detached from the plants in high water and get swept downstream and settle on other sections of riverbank.  In very mild British and Irish winters, the first flowers open in January, but February and March are the\n    main times when you will see riverbanks and roadsides carpeted with Snowdrops. Because they tend to be mainly small, most of the flies and other insects of early spring tend to go unnoticed; however, they seem to have no difficulty finding Snowdrops, which benefit from their assistance with pollination. This wildflower was described scientifically by the great Swedish botanist   who, in 1753, gave the Snowdrop its currently-accepted scientific (binomial) name  Inevitably, because of their beauty and  the fact that they bloom so early in the year when few flowers are evident, Snowdrops have been subject to extensive cultivation. Gardeners can now choose from a range of sizes and blossom forms, including double varieties; and some cultivars bloom in January while others have been selectively bred to provide displays well into March and even April. Snowdrop bulbs are poisonous, and so it is important to keep them away from places where young children might pick them up and eat them.  The genus name   was established by  ; it comes from the Greek words  , meaning milk, and - , meaning a flower - a milky white flower, therefore. Much more obvious is the Latin origin of the specific name  , which means 'of the snow' - a reference to the season in which these flowers bloom. The origin of the common name Snowdrop is hotly (or should that be frostily!) contested, but before they open fully the flowers are shaped very much like raindrops but their colour is snowy white. There have been several other suggestions for the origin of the common name, but that one is quite good enough for us! Spring Snowflake   has six equal tepals (petals and sepals) in a bell-like flower.  Autumn Snowflake   is similar to the Spring Snowflake but it has pink-tinged flowers in the autumn.

Instantly recognisable by its bright glossy yellow flowers,   (formerly  ) has a variable number of petals. While eight to ten petals are typical, we have found individual Lesser Celandine flowers with as many as 13 petals. (Petal counting is a sad hobby!) Each flower stalk bears a single flower, always with just three sepals, The leaves are heart shaped, veined and and usually patterned in light and dark green.  Celandines are pollinated by  , and in early springtime many of these are small flies of the order Diptera - two-winged flies sometimes referred to as the 'true flies'. As with other members of the buttercup family, the green seeds are clustered in a spiky ball.  Lesser Celandine is a very common and widespread spring wildflower throughout Britain and Ireland. This plants is also found across most temperate regions of of Europe and Asia. In North America Ficaria verna is an introduced alien species and has become a nuisance invasive weed.  Lesser Celandines have a preference for the edges of damp woodland, hedgerows, ditches and riverbanks, but shady lawns that are not treated with weed-and-feed chemicals can also sport displays of celandines in springtime. It always cheers us up tremendously to see the first displays of Lesser Celandines on bright sunny days; It means that spring is on the way. In Britain and Ireland as early as February, and in sheltered locations sometimes even before the end of January, Lesser Celandines can usually be seen in flower from March to early June. This lovely wildflower was described scientifically by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, in the first edition of his   of 1753.  Linnaeus gave the Lesser Celandine the binomial name   by which it was generally known until recently, when Ficaria verna was adopted following DNA investigation of plants in the family Ranunculaceae. Botanists generally recognise two varieties of Lesser Celandines. There is a variety that produces bulbils at its leaf axils and is referred to as var,  One of the other common names of this wildsflower  is Pilewort, which comes from the appearance (like piles or haemorrhoids) of the knobbly tubers from which these plants grow.  In line with the 'doctrine of signatures', whereby plants were used to treat ailments affecting parts of the body that they resembled, Pilewort was used to treat haemorrhoids. The common name Celandine may come from the Latin  , via 13th century English celydon.   comes from the Greek  , meaning a Swallow. The flowering of the Lesser Celandine was thought to coincide with the arrival in Northern Europe of swallows from their southern wintering grounds in South Africa, southern Asia and India. The theory was that when the flowers faded the swallows would also depart, although in our experience there are usually plenty of Swallows remaining in Britain long after the last of the Lesser Celandines has faded and died. The older genus name   comes from the Latin  , meaning frog, while the suffix -  indicates the diminutive form - hence   means 'little frog'. The most likely explanation is that both frogs and Lesser Celandines are usually found in damp places. In the USA this plant is generally referred to as the Fig Buttercup, a reference to the root structure of the plant, whose new genus name   means 'of a fig'. Marsh-marigold   has larger flowers with overlapping petals.  Despite its common name, the GreaterCelandine   is not a close relative; it is a kind of poppy and it flowers much later in the year.

Foxgloves are biennials, although occasionally plants can live longer than two years. They grow to well over a metre in height and are a splendid sight on the banks ofrivers, lakes and canals as well as on roadsides and woodland edges.   Foxgloves favour acid soils. In the lowlands they do not thrive in heavy, wet clay, but cope much better in sandy, well-drained areas.  In our experience the situation can be rather different in the uplands, where these stately wildflowers often line the eroding banks of small fast-flowing streams and colonise sheltered stony gullies, but they tend to shun waterlogged and marshy areas.  These lovely wildflowers are found throughout Britain and Ireland, and they are common throughout most of mainland Europe, even as far south as the   region of Portugal. This species was introduced to gardens in many other parts of the world including North America, where in many areas it has since escaped into the wild and become naturalised.    In hedgerows facing the sunny south, Foxgloves provide a splendid display throughoutthe summer months. We think of Foxgloves not as spring flowers but as the first of the common summer wildflowers. In sheltered lowland spots a few early spikes may appear in early June, with the main display in July and stragglers, particularly those cut down by roadside hedge cutters, pushing up a few inferior spike through to late August.  High in the hills, and particularly in northern Britain, Foxgloves hardly get going until July, and they continue to look good throughout August and into September, by which time the lower flowers have lost their corollas and show their seed cases. Late side shoots may produce a few small flowers.  There are many beautiful cultivars and subspecies of Foxglove. If sowing them as seeds you will need to allow a year for germination and growth, with overwintered plants flowering in the following year.  By removing the dead flowerheads you will encourage a further display of flowers later in the year. (Where we live in West Wales, a few straggly Foxgloves can often be found in bloom as late as November, and they will often pop up and re-flower even after savage cutting back once the main spike has shed its flowers.)  The pharmaceutical compounds digitoxin and digoxin are used to make the drug digitalis, used as a heart stimulant. It was from Foxgloves that these chemicals were first isolated and purified. In the past herbalists made great use of  , whose leaves were also used to make a kind of tea. (We strongly advise against eating or using as medicines any plants without first obtaining qualified professional advice.)  The generic name   was given to this species and its close relatives by the famous Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 publication  ; the name   comes from the Latin noun  , which of course means finger.  The individual flowers of the Foxglove are indeed finger shaped, and they also fit very neatly onto the finger like the fingers of a glove or indeed like finger puppets; however, for people with sensitive skin it is important to be aware that just touching foxgloves can be enough to cause itching or even more seriously unpleasant skin irritations.

The umbrella-like white heads of this biennial wildflower usually have in their centres a single purple flower with unequal petals. The white florets each have five tiny petals 2-3mm long, and the lower bracts behind the flower heads are conspicuously pinnate (divided into three spikes).   Narrowly-branching hairy stems of Wild Carrot grow to a metre in height, with alternating feathery leaves finely divided into bi-pinnate or more often tri-pinnate leaflets. At the base of the stem there is a narrow taproot, but it bears very little resemblance to the roots of carrots grown in cultivation.  As soon as its flowers start to go to seed, Wild Carrot is instantly reconisable and quite unlike any of the other white-flowered umbellifers. The seed heads change shape in a remarkable way... As the outer stems of the umbellifer curve inwards, they crush the other stems together into either a concave dish (like a shallow bird's nest) or siometimes into a tightly-knoted ball. The spiny fruits are also very distinctive. Common and widespread in Britain and Ireland, especially in coastal areas, Wild Carrot's geographical range covers temperate parts of Europe and southwest Asia, but its origin is thought to have been parts of western Asia from where it was transported to Europe several hundred years ago. In other parts of the world, including Australia and North America, this umbellifer is an introduced alien species.    This mainly coastal plant is a summer wildflower of dry grassland; it can be seen in swathes on the verges of country lanes, field boundaries and sheltered grassy cliffs and dunes near the sea. In Britain and Ireland Wild Carrot can be seen in flower from June through to late August or early September.     Cultivated carrots come from the variety  , var  , but the roots of Wild Carrot itself taste much the same and can be eaten when young; however, the roots of old plants become tough and unpalatable.

One of the old common names for this wildflower is Queen Anne's Lace; one explanation is that the tiny purple floret in the centre represents the queen and the surrounding white florets make up her lace collar. Another theory is thatQueen Anne pricked her finger when lace-making, and the purple spot is her blood.

Accurate identification of this subspecies is confusing due to the occurence of white forms or varieties of Early Marsh-orchid which are possibly more common than subspecies   Since cautious reports of finding this subspecies in Southwest Wales have largely been dismissed, it seems that it may be confined to a few scattered sites in East Anglia. The other two white forms are described as var. l  and var.   Interestingly the 'white-coloured' Early Marsh Orchids tend to be taller plants and the flower spikes are often much laxer in appearance. Although the Early Marsh-orchid is well and truly alive and well in Wales, it is extremely vulnerable to habitat change: prolonged dry weather over several seasons causes colonies to degenerate, as does the spread of rank growth of competing plants in the areas where they grow.  In Wales (at Kenfig National Nature Reserve) there is a  being undertaken, principally to try and arrest the decline of the Fen Orchid  but which should also benefit the Early Marsh-orchid by reducing some of the competing rank vegetation.

This orchid is very common in Wales, where we live, and pops up all over the place - in the sand dunes at many of our coastal nature reserves, on roadside verges, roundabouts and central reservations (they thrive there because of the limestone chippings used to assist with drainage) as well as in unimproved grassland sites. Provided the soil conditions are calcareous and the ground has not been doused with pesticides and herbicides you are quite likely to find the Common Spotted-orchid. In Britain and Ireland the peak flowering time for Common Spotted-orchid is June.  Also found in Wales are the hybrid with Southern Marsh-orchid  , -   - and the variety  var.   The latter is rare, while the former is probably very common but may be easily confused with either or both parent plants.  is a tall and robust plant with darkly-spotted leaves and deep-pink flowers. It is found where both parents occur, and occasionally where they apparently do not. This hybrid plant is capable of producing seed, and so hybrid swarms sometimes occur.   var.   is widespread throughout the UK but rare. The leaves of the plant are more heavily spotted and are also sometimes reported as being almost completely purple. The lip of the flower is also a distinguishing feature, having a block of dark purple colouring, due to excessive pigmentation, in the centre and with a paler border.

This trailing hairless perennial plant has lilac two-lipped flowers with two yellowish bulges on the lower lip. Its curved spur is unusually short for a toadflax. Flowers are 9 to 15mm across and each is borne on a long stalk growing from a leaf base. It is easy to see how this plant spreads so rapidly: the fruit capsules develop on long stalks that gradually recurve towards the growing substrate and tuck their oval seeds into any likely places where the plant can get new toe-holds.   The long-stalked leaves of Ivy-leaved Toadflax are palmate (sometimes but not always shaped rather like the leaves of Ivy!) with 3 to 7 lobes and ranging between 2.5 and 5cm across. Leaves alternate along the thin creeping red-flushed stems, which root at nodes whenever they find a suitable crevice. It seems meaningless to discus the 'height' of a plant that is equally at home on vertical and horizontal surfaces, but   is low growing and the flowers are rarely more than 10cm away from the substrate.  Native to the Mediterranean region and thought to have been brought to London with imported marble slabs from Italy in 1640, Ivy-leaved Toadflax was planted in gardens and has since escaped and become naturalised and very common throughout Britain and Ireland except for some parts of northern Scotland.    Now very common throughout most of northern, central and southern Europe,   has also become naturalised in many other parts of the world including North America, where its invasive qualities have resulted in a widespread distribution.     is mainly found growing in and over walls, piles of rubble and similar places where its roots can get a grip in sparse soil that does not remain wet long enough for other plants to take over. The first flowers of Ivy-leaved Toadflax usually appear April and continue through to at least the end of September. In sheltered southern locations flowers can be seen all year round except in the harshest of winters. Bare walls are made more attractive when colonised by Ivy-leaved Toadflax, but it is rarely necessary to plant these wildflowers because seeds, complete with a starter-pack of organic growing medium, are usually delivered by birds. The fruits are capsule-shaped which grow on long stalks that gradually recurve towards and into a likely place where the plant can get a new 'toe-hold'.

Usually 15 to 40 cm tall, this untidy biennial plant is best admired from a distance. Its succulent lower leaves, varying from dark green to red and even deep purple, are held close to the ground.    The fragrant, four-petalled flowers, 8 to 15mm across, are usually white but sometimes tinged with mauve or purple. Once the short-lived petals have fallen from the flowers, roundish seed pods swell and ripen. Found throughout Britain and Ireland, Common Scurvy-grass occurs also in coastal regions of northern and central Europe; it is also found, although much less frequently, in some mountainous inland locations.   This plant is common only near the coast, where it grows on grassy cliffs, in salt marshes and on coastal roadside lanes where winter salting adds to the natural salinity. Inland locations near salt mines and saline springs are also favoured by Common Scurvy-grass.   Heavily salted main roads inland sometimes have central reservations and verges lined with Common Scurvy-grass, but more often the species seen there is the much smaller Danish Scurvy-grass  . Surprisingly, in view of Common Scurvy-grass's apparent craving for salt, there are also some mountain sites in northern England and in Scotland where   has been recorded. The first flowers appear in April, but May is the best month for this member of the Cabbage family. You will see odd patches of scurvy-grass inbloom throughout the summer. Sailors ate scurvy-grass when at sea to ward off the debilitating diseaseof scurvy, which is caused by a deficiency of vitamin C.   The symptoms of scurvy are spongy and bleeding gums, bleeding beneath the skin, and extreme weakness. The sharp-tasting leaves of this plant are very high in vitamin C, and at one time scurvy-grass ale was a popular tonic drink. In herbal medicine   was used for its antiseptic properties. , the generic name, comes from the Greek noun  , meaning a spoon; it is a reference to the spoon-shaped lower leaves of plants in this genus. The specific epithet   is Latin and translates to 'official' - a description that was applied to many plants that were deemed to be of high pharmaceutical value. The common name is sometimes written as Scurvygrass or occasionally as Scurvy Grass.  Several similar Scurvy-grass species occur in Britain and Ireland, but the two most common species are   and  .

Marsh Cinquefoil, a relatively uncommon sight in some regions of Britain and Ireland, occurs also in many parts of mainland Europe, in northern Asia, and in North America.   is an acid-loving wildflower; it grows mainly in peaty marshes, swamps and fens and in the shallow margins of unpolluted upland lakes. In Ireland some of the high moorland in County Wicklow has Marsh Cinquefoil in ditches and other damp hollows and along the margins of rivers and streams. From early June until late August the ruby red flowers of Marsh Cinquefoil are a great source of nectar for bees and many other kinds of insects that swarm around ponds and other wetland sites..   In the past the roots of this plant were used to dye leather a reddish-yellow colour, and a red dye was produced from the flowers. Marsh Cinquefoil leaves are reputed to be good for making tea. Their rarity today makes collecting leaves or flowers of Marsh Cinquefoil not merely difficult but ecologically unforgiveable.  may come from the Latin noun  , meaning hair (of the head), a reference to the hairy sepals.

Originally a wildflower of the Mediterranean region, this European wildflower has been introduced into the wild in northern Europe, mainly via garden escapes. In parts of Australia and North America where Red Valerian occurs it is an introduced alien species. Between the stonework of walls, bridges and other vertical surfaces seem to be very attractive to this pretty wildflower, which is most commonly seen in coastal districts. Red Valerian is a common sight on railway embankments and coastal paths and on some reservoir dam walls. The flowers first appear towards the end of May, andyou will find red valerian (which also has a white variety, as shown above) in flower right through to the end of September and in sheltered places right through to the end of the year. The leaves of Red Valerian and roots can be eaten - the leaves either fresh in salads or lightly boiled, and he roots boiled in soups. Opinions differ as to whether either makes particularly good eating. Although Red Valerian is  reported by some sources to have medicinal properties, this is probably due to confusion with Common Valerian,  .

Common Valerian   has very similar but much paler pink flowers; it usually blooms from June until the end of August. The leaves of Common Valerian are pinnate, pointed and toothed, whereas the leaves of Red Valerian are oval or lanceolate."},

Cow Parsley is a tall downy plant growing to a metre or more in height. This wildflower can be either biennial or perennial, spreading rapidly in rich damp soil both by seed and via its rhizomes. The umbrella-shaped flower ubels are typically 3cm to 6cm across, with larger petals near the outer edges of the florets. The distinctive leaves of this common wildflower (see above) are finely divided into many feathery leaflets. The leaf stalks and the hiollow stems often turn a rich purple as the plants age. Fruits of Cow Parsley are like elongated smooth teardrops; they gradually turn black as they ripen.  This member of the Carrot family is very common in Britain, Ireland, and most of northern Europe. In North America, Cow Parsley is an introduced alien and considered to be a nuisance invasive weed.    In many parts of western Britain and Ireland Cow Parsley takes over the grassy verges beside hedgerows (as can be seen in the picture below), eventually blanketing out most of the smaller wildflowers. Cow Parsley flowers first appear in April and they last through to the end of June.As these tall roadside wildflowers are dying back so several other umbellifers including Hogweed   and Wild Angelica  are just coming into bloom. , the genus name, is of uncertain (to us) origin. The specific epithet   often implies 'of the woods', but in this instance it is perhaps used simply to denote 'growing wild'.    Hollow stems of Cow Parsley are traditional materials from which children make peashooters. There is a danger, however, that poisonous plants such as Hemlock   or Giant Hogweed Heracleum mantegazzianum might be used by mistake, with painful and possibly disastrous consequences.  Cow Parsley is said to be edible but rather bitter tasting. (We strongly advise against eating or using as medicines any plants without first obtaining qualified professional advice.)  Hedge Parsley   flowers later than Cow Parsley and its flowers often have a pink tinge. Hemlock   has hollow purple-spotted stems; it is seriously poisonous.  Hogweed   is as common as Cow Parsley but produces its flowers in late spring and summer; the leaves are much larger and only coarsely divided.

This woodland wildflower was described scientifically by the great Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, in the first edition of his  , published in 1753. Linnaeus gave the Wood Anemone the binomial name   by which it is generally known to botanists today.

Occasionally you may come across blue-petalled variants of this lovely little wildflower; once in a while we encounter both colour forms growing together (but the two flower colours are always on separate plants). In June 2014 during a visit to Slovenia we came across plenty of Scarlet Pimpernel (brick red form) lining the verges of a main road, and among these prolific conventional plants were numerous with pale mauve flowers.

The best of the flowers of Garlic Mustard or Jack-by-the-Hedge appear in April and early May, but you can occasionally find a few blooms right through until August. Jack-by-the-Hedge is edible and, if collected when young, the leaves make an excellent addition to salads, sauces and other dishes. , the genus name, means 'of the allium family', and is botanically incorrect; however, as a reference to the odour of these plants it seems quite appropriate. Garlic Mustard often grows beside hedges, which is where its alternative common name Jack-by-the-Hedge says that it belongs!  The specific epithet   means having petioles - stalks connecting the leaves to the main stems - as indeed the leaves of Garlic Mustard do."},

The blue-violet flowers are typically 1.5cm long and have a pattern of  veins on the lower lip. Bugle can grow up to 20cm tall but is often little more than half that height. The plants propagate mainly by growing surface runners (which are known as stolons) that root at intervals along their length.  Unlike its close relative Pyramidal Bugle  , this plant is common throughout Britain and Ireland and is found also across much of mainland Europe.   Bugle prefers heavy, wet soils and forms large, dense mats in favoured locations. This attractive low creeping perennial wildflower thrives on woodland edges and in damp grassland.  In Britain the first flowers usually appear in April, and Bugle continues blooming until late June or early July. The lips of the flowers are veined with darker blue.

The hollow stems are grooved but hairless and the leaves are darkish green in early springtime, turning yellower in summer. Flat-topped umbels of white flowers bearing a passing resemblance to the flowers of an Elder tree are the origin of this plant's common name.. Found throughout Britain and Ireland, Ground Elder occurs also in most parts of mainland Europe and in Asia. As an introduced alien species this plant is a nuisance weed in North America, New Zealand and Australia.  It is considered possible that the Romans may have introduced ground elder to Britain; a clue as to why they might have done so can be found in one of its many other common names: Gout Weed!  Ground Elder favours damp soil and shady locations, but it copes well with soil disturbance and so is often associated with waste land and the margins of rubbish tips. The first flowers appear in May and are usually past their (unspectacular) best by the end of July; however, cutting before the flowering season is ineffective as a control mechanism because this plant is propagated mainly via its spreading roots; leave even the tiniest piece in the ground and it will quickly give rise to a new plant.

Sneezewort is most often found on damp acid grassland and frequently beside streams, especially on heavy clay-based soils. Other sites where you are likely to find Sneezewort include heathland, watermeadows and marshes. The flowers first appear in July and sneezewort usually continues blooming into September.

The roots were used to induce sneezing (not to cure it!).  \n       Chewing the roots of Sneezewort was a recommended treatment (if not a guaranteed cure) for toothache - although whether the offending tooth was to be sneezed out of its socket remains unclear! In the past, dried and powdered leaves from this plant were been used as a 'sneezing powder'. Medicinal properties are also claimed for an essential oil that can be extracted from Sneezewort leaves which, despite being bitter tasting, have also been used in salads. Given that this wildflower is known to be seriously poisonous to some farm animals, including cattle and horses, we cannot recommend Sneezewort for human consumption.
